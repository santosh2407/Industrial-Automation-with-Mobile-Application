# Industrial-Automation-with-Mobile-Application

- In this project, I propose an efficient industrial automation system that allows users to efficiently control industry appliances/machines over the internet. For a demonstration of this system, we use 2 loads as industrial appliances or machines and 2 motors to demonstrate an industrial motor. 
- This system uses ESP8266 as a microcontroller for processing all user commands which also has an inbuilt wi-fi module to connect to the internet and receive user commands from a mobile application which is mainly designed for controlling this system.
